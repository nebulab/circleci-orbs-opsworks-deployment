# OpsWorks Deployment CircleCI Orb

[opsworks-deployment](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/nebulab/opsworks-deployment)

## Description

This Orb can be used to deploy any app that adopts [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)
to AWS OpsWorks.

When a branch is merged into `master`, it will deploy to your staging stack and send a Slack 
notification. When you approve the CircleCI workflow to continue, it will deploy to your production
stack and notify you on Slack again. 

## Usage

Add the following to your CircleCI configuration:

```yaml
version: 2.1

  opsworks: nebulab/opsworks-deployment@6.0.0
